## Contributing

After cloning this repository, install necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Executing tests

```bash
npm run test -- [additional options]
# or
npm t -- [additional options]
```

The command accepts the following options:

* `--coverage` (`-c`) &ndash; Whether to generate the code coverage.
* `--source-map` (`-s`) &ndash; Whether to attach the source maps.
* `--watch` (`-w`) &ndash; Whether to watch test files.
* `--reporter` (`-r`) &ndash; Reporter for Karma (default: `mocha`, can be changed to `dots`).
* `--browsers` (`-b`) &ndash; Browsers that will be used to run tests (default: `Chrome`, available: `Firefox`).

If you are going to change the component (`src/ckeditor.js`) or plugin (`src/plugin.js`) files, remember about rebuilding the package. You can use `npm run develop` in order to do it automatically.

### Building the package

Build a minified version of the package that is ready to publish:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Changelog generator

```bash
npm run changelog
```

### Testing component with Vue CLI

When symlinking the component in an application generated using [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/), make sure your `vue.config.js` file configures webpack in the following way:

```js
module.exports = {
	configureWebpack: {
		resolve: {
			symlinks: false
		}
	}
};
```

Otherwise, the application will fail to load the component correctly and, as a result, it will throw a build error.

## Releasing package

### Changelog

Before starting the release process, you need to generate the changelog:

```bash
npm run changelog
```

### Publishing

After generating the changelog, you are able to release the package.

First, you need to bump the version:

```bash
npm run release:bump-version
```

You can also use the `--dry-run` option in order to see what this task does.

After bumping the version, you can publish the changes:

```bash
npm run release:publish
```

Note: Only the `dist/` directory will be published.
